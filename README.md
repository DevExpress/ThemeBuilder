The DevExtreme ThemeBuilder allows you to modify themes shipped with DevExtreme or create custom themes. This tool is available [online](https://devexpress.github.io/ThemeBuilder/).
 
If you need to run the ThemeBuilder locally (for example, when working with a pre-release version or a version with a hotfix applied), clone this repository and follow the instructions below.

## Prerequisites

You will need Node.js 8.9 or higher and npm 5.5.1 or higher. The app is built using angular-cli. Run `npm install @angular/cli -g` to install it.

## Install required packages and Launch

```
npm install
npm start
```

If you need a specific version of the `devextreme` package, change it in the package.json file. Note that the `devextreme-themebuilder` and `devextreme-angular` packages' version should also be the same.
